[quote=About this mod]The Payday map inspired people once again, and someone suggested to be able to make more of those explosive cakes that you can find at the birthday party ^^
There was several cake models in the game already, so I didn't use the one you can see at the party on the Payday map, but another one that can be more easily identified as a cake in my opinion :)
Taking the creamy explosion effect and adding it to that cake was not really hard, but I had to work a bit more than usual with the editor (and less with code) in order to link correctly the cake model with the correct explosive effect and sound.
